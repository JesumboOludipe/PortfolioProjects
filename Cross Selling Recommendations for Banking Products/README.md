#Data-Driven Customer Behavior Analysis and Cross-Selling Opportunities in a Spanish Bank

In today's data-driven world, companies are continually looking for ways to utilize data to make better decisions and boost their bottom line. One critical area where data can be beneficial is in understanding customer behavior and finding cross-selling opportunities. In this article, we will explore how a large Spanish bank leveraged data analysis to gain insights into customer behavior and identify cross-selling opportunities.

##Dataset and Methodology
The dataset contained 13,647,308 records of the bank's customers and the various products they own, such as savings accounts, current accounts, mortgages, loans, and credit cards. The analysis involved several steps, including data cleaning, feature engineering, exploratory data analysis, and data visualization. Python was used for the analysis, and pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib libraries were utilized. This dataset was generously provided to me during my ongoing internship with Data Glacier.
Data Cleaning 
Data cleaning is an essential step to ensure the accuracy and reliability of any downstream analysis or use. In this case, the bank was a Latina-American bank, which meant many column names and data values were in Spanish. Therefore, these words or abbreviations had to be translated into English for better comprehension. 
First, the column names were changed to be more descriptive. Gender values were standardized from "H" and "V" to "M" and "F," and "S" and "N" were changed to "Yes" and "No," respectively. Rows with missing values were removed. The appropriate data types were assigned to each column. Lastly, any Spanish words in the dataset were translated into English for consistency. A dataframe was then created with unique customer IDs and the most recent data date to facilitate the analysis, leaving us with 949,609 unique customers.

##Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a crucial step in any data analysis project, as it helps us understand the data structure, uncover patterns and relationships, and identify potential outliers or anomalies. One of the first things that the analysis looked at was the gender distribution. It was observed that the majority of the customers in the dataset were female (54.29%), while male customers made up a slightly smaller percentage (45.71%).
From the analysis, it was seen that the majority of customers fall in the age group of 41-60 years old, accounting for 33.26% of the total customers, followed by the age group of 19-25 years old, accounting for 27.90%. The least represented age group was 0-18 years old, accounting for only 0.86% of the total customers.
These insights suggest that the bank can focus on targeting and tailoring its marketing strategies towards the 41-60 age group, as they represent the largest portion of its customer base. 

The majority of the customers fall in the income group of 50,000 - 100,000, accounting for 38.35% of the total customers, followed by the income group of 100,000 - 150,000, accounting for 24.17%. Customers in the higher income groups such as 1,000,000 - 50,000,000 make up only a small percentage of the total customer base.
Based on this analysis, the bank can focus its marketing efforts towards the income groups with the highest representation, i.e., 50,000 - 100,000 and 100,000 - 150,000, to retain and attract more customers. 

The analysis also looked at the distribution of the number of products owned by customers. The majority of customers owned 0-2 products, with a small percentage owning 5 or more products. This information can be helpful in targeting different customer segments with personalized marketing strategies.
The analysis of the bankâ€™s customer data has revealed significant potential for cross-selling and revenue growth. Almost half of the customers have only one bank product, while more than a quarter have none, indicating a vast opportunity to increase the number of bank products held by customers. To capitalize on this potential, the bank should identify the needs and preferences of its customers and offer them relevant products that could benefit them.
The analysis shows that the most commonly owned products were current accounts and debit cards, while the least commonly owned products were savings accounts and guarntees. The bank should monitor the usage patterns of different account types and adjust its marketing and promotional strategies accordingly. By doing so, the bank can retain customers and attract new ones.

Furthermore, I identified the top 10 cross-selling opportunities for the bank, such as cross-selling particular accounts to current account customers and payroll accounts to customers interested in pension plans and direct debits. Based on these insights, the bank can create targeted marketing campaigns to promote cross-selling opportunities, such as offering attractive packages that combine payroll accounts with pension plans or direct debits. By implementing these strategies, the bank can increase its cross-selling rates and generate more revenue from its existing customer base.

##Recommendations
To increase cross-selling and revenue at XYZ Credit Union, here are some recommendations:
1. Develop targeted marketing campaigns
2. Train employees on cross-selling
3. Streamline product offerings
4. Improve customer experience
5. Focus on customers who own only one product
6. Analyze product bundles
7. Analyze customer behavior
8. Leverage customer feedback

In conclusion, this project demonstrated the value of data analysis and visualization in understanding customer behavior and identifying business opportunities. With the power of data, businesses can gain a competitive edge and make informed decisions to drive growth and success.
