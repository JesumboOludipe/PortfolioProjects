## Projects
### Data Cleaning in SQL - Nashville Housing Data ([View Script](https://github.com/JesumboOludipe/PortfolioProjects/blob/main/Data%20Cleaning%20in%20SQL%20-%20Nashville%20Housing%20Data.sql))

**Description:** The objective of this project was to perform data cleaning on the Nashville Housing Data using SQL. The dataset contained information on the properties sold in Nashville from 2013 to 2019, including details such as location, sale price, square footage, and number of bedrooms and bathrooms. The data may have contained inconsistencies, missing values, and errors, which could affect the accuracy and reliability of the analysis. Therefore, the project aimed to identify and resolve these issues, ensuring that the data was accurate and consistent.

**Skills:** The project required proficiency in SQL, including the ability to write complex queries, aggregate functions, and data manipulation statements. Familiarity with data cleaning techniques such as data profiling, data normalization, and data standardization was also necessary. Additionally, knowledge of data quality assessment and data governance principles enhanced the quality of the data cleaning process.

**Technology:** SQL Server, Excel.

**Result:** The project resulted in a cleaned and standardized dataset, ensuring that the data was accurate and consistent. This led to more reliable analysis and insights into the Nashville housing market, which could be used by real estate professionals, investors, and policymakers to make informed decisions about buying, selling, and developing properties in Nashville. Additionally, the project can serve as a template for data cleaning in other markets and industries, enabling organizations to improve the quality of their data and enhance their decision-making capabilities.


### Data Correlation in Python - Movies Data ([View Code])(https://github.com/JesumboOludipe/PortfolioProjects/blob/main/Data%20Correlation%20in%20Python%20-%20Movies%20Dataset.ipynb)
**Description:** The objective of this project was to analyze the factors that affect the gross revenue of movies using Python. The dataset consisted of 6,820 movies released from 1986 to 2016, with information such as the movie title, release date, budget, box office revenue, user ratings, genre, director, and production company. The project aimed to identify the correlations between these factors and the gross revenue of the movies, providing insights into the movie industry's success factors.

**Skills:** The project required expertise in Python, including data wrangling, data visualization, and statistical analysis. Knowledge of correlation analysis, regression analysis, and hypothesis testing was also necessary. Additionally, familiarity with data cleaning techniques and data normalization was vital to ensuring the accuracy and reliability of the analysis.

**Technology:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Jupyter Notebook.

**Result:** The project resulted in identifying the key factors that affect the gross revenue of movies. The analysis found that factors such as budget, production company, director, and user ratings had a significant correlation with the gross revenue of movies. The results could be used by movie industry professionals, investors, and policymakers to make informed decisions about movie production, marketing, and distribution. Additionally, the project provided a framework for correlation analysis in other industries and datasets, enabling organizations to gain insights into their success factors.
