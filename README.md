#### Data Exploration in SQL - Nashville Housing Data
Description: The goal of this project is to perform data exploration and analysis on the Nashville Housing Data using SQL. The dataset contains information on the properties sold in Nashville from 2013 to 2019, including details such as location, sale date, sale price, square footage, and number of bedrooms and bathrooms. By leveraging SQL queries and functions, we aim to gain insights into the Nashville housing market, such as trends in prices, popular locations, and housing preferences.

Familiarity with data exploration techniques such as filtering, sorting, and grouping is also necessary. Additionally, knowledge of statistical analysis and visualization tools can enhance the quality of the insights gained from the data.

Technology: SQL Server, Excel.

Result: The project provided valuable insights into the Nashville housing market, such as trends in prices, popular locations, and housing preferences. These insights could be used by real estate professionals and investors to make informed decisions about buying and selling properties in Nashville. Additionally, the project can serve as a template for data exploration and analysis in other markets and industries.
