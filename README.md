### Data-Driven Customer Behavior Analysis and Cross-Selling Opportunities in a Spanish Bank ([View Project](https://github.com/JesumboOludipe/PortfolioProjects/tree/main/Cross%20Selling%20Recommendations%20for%20Banking%20Products))
**Description:** This project aimed to analyze the customer behavior of a large Spanish bank and identify cross-selling opportunities to increase revenue. The dataset contained over 13 million records of customer data, including the various products they own. The project utilized Python programming language and popular data analysis libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib. The analysis involved several stages, including data cleaning, feature engineering, exploratory data analysis, and data visualization.

**Skills:** The project required skills in data analysis, data cleaning, feature engineering, exploratory data analysis, data visualization, and programming in Python. The ability to communicate findings and make recommendations based on insights from the data was also essential.

**Technology:** The project utilized Python programming language and popular data analysis libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib. The analysis was conducted on a Jupyter Notebook environment.

**Result:** The analysis revealed several insights into customer behavior and identified cross-selling opportunities for the bank. The majority of customers were female, and the largest age group was 41-60 years old. Customers with an income of 50,000 - 100,000 were the largest income group. The majority of customers owned 0-2 products, presenting an opportunity for cross-selling. The most commonly owned products were current accounts and debit cards, while the least commonly owned products were savings accounts and guarantees. The analysis identified the top 10 cross-selling opportunities for the bank. Based on these insights, the bank could develop targeted marketing campaigns, train employees on cross-selling, streamline product offerings, improve the customer experience, focus on customers who own only one product, analyze product bundles, analyze customer behavior, and leverage customer feedback to increase cross-selling and revenue. This project demonstrated the value of data analysis and visualization in understanding customer behavior and identifying business opportunities.
